# classification-UCL-Gas-Sensors-Array-temperature
prediction of the temperature of the array of 14 metal oxide gas sensors
Python code for machine learning (Logistic Regression) of data set "Gas sensor array temperature modulation"
more details and all data sets are provided at:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+temperature+modulation

The link above provides 13 data sets regarding to the same measurement of the same set of gas-sensor arrays at different times (repeated experimnet)
Using the oldest measurement (data set "20160930_203718.csv"), the training and prediction using logistic regression are performed.
Two main tasks down in this python code includes:
1. converting continuse numeric data (temperature) into categorical data
2. training data and predicting the resulst and changing the classes to see the effect of number of classes on the occuracy of the calculations.

The README file of the author of the paper as well as the original papers are provided.
